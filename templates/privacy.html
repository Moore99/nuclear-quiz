        <hr>

        <h5>1. Introduction</h5>
        <p>Nuclear Quiz ("the App") is operated by Kernkraft Consulting Inc. ("we", "us", "our").
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

        <h5>2. Information We Collect</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Account information: username, encrypted password hash</li>
            <li>Quiz activity: questions answered, scores, categories attempted, timestamps</li>
            <li>Device information: device type, OS version, app version (for crash reporting)</li>
            <li>Advertising identifiers: Google Advertising ID / IDFA (used by AdMob for ad targeting)</li>
            <li>Analytics: screen views, feature usage, session duration (Firebase Analytics)</li>
            <li>Crash data: stack traces and device state at time of crash (Firebase Crashlytics)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>3. Biometric Data</h5>
        <p>If you enable biometric login, biometric data (Face ID, fingerprint) is processed
        entirely by your device's operating system. We never access, store, or transmit biometric data.</p>

        <h5>4. How We Use Your Information</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and operate the App and your account</li>
            <li>To save and display your quiz progress and statistics</li>
            <li>To display advertisements via Google AdMob</li>
            <li>To analyse usage and improve the App</li>
            <li>To diagnose and fix crashes and errors</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>5. Google AdMob</h5>
        <p>The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may use your advertising
        identifier and device information to show interest-based ads. You can opt out in your device settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Android: Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalisation</li>
            <li>iOS: Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Apple Advertising &gt; Personalised Ads (off)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a></p>

        <h5>6. Firebase</h5>
        <p>The App uses Google Firebase for analytics and crash reporting. Analytics data is
        aggregated and anonymised. Crash reports may include device state but do not include
        personally identifiable information beyond device identifiers.</p>

        <h5>7. In-App Purchases</h5>
        <p>If you purchase "Remove Ads", your payment is processed by Apple or Google according
        to their respective terms. We receive confirmation of the purchase but not payment details.
        Purchase records are stored on our server to restore your purchase on new devices.</p>

        <h5>8. Data Sharing</h5>
        <p>We do not sell personal information. We share data only with Google (AdMob, Firebase)
        and Apple/Google Play (for IAP verification). No other third parties.</p>

        <h5>9. Data Retention</h5>
        <p>Account data is retained while your account is active. You may delete your account at any time
        from the Account screen or by contacting
        <a href="mailto:privacy@nuclear-motd.com">privacy@nuclear-motd.com</a>.
        Firebase analytics data is retained for 14 months per Firebase defaults.</p>

        <h5>10. Children's Privacy</h5>
        <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from
        children under 13.</p>

        <h5>11. Your Rights (GDPR / PIPEDA)</h5>
        <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Contact us at
        <a href="mailto:privacy@nuclear-motd.com">privacy@nuclear-motd.com</a>.</p>

        <h5>12. Security</h5>
        <p>Data is transmitted over HTTPS. Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text.
        Auth tokens are stored in device secure storage (Keychain on iOS, EncryptedSharedPreferences on Android).</p>

        <h5>13. Changes</h5>
        <p>We may update this policy. The updated date above will reflect changes. Continued
        use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
